        `OriOn MusicX, just like the dogs app, is part of the practical stage at Henry, there I had to form a work team to develop a web application, we found a problem and decided to find a solution, we discovered that the distribution of content from producers/singers/creators of content, it was often stagnant due to music or because it was not easy to obtain it, so we created a platform, an e-Commerce where user licenses can be obtained for this audience.

        Since I discovered the world of development, I have been passionate about what I do, my great passion is music, OriOn MusicX was born that way, I had this problem and why not combine two things that I love to do?
        Lastly, I didn't want them not to know a part that i love about myself, music.`,
